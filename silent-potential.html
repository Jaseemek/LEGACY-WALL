 <!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <span class="highlighted">Code of Consistency</span>
    <p>
      is not just a system — it’s the heart of Silent Equity. It was born from failure, frustration, and a brutal realization that the market doesn’t reward talent — it rewards consistency. Designed for traders who are stuck in the loop of emotional trading, impulsive decisions, and false starts, this framework brings structure, discipline, and clarity to those who truly want to transform.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, the Code emphasizes repeatable routines, risk control, emotional tracking, journaling, and a sharp focus on process over outcome. It doesn’t push you to trade more — it teaches you to trade better, with control and composure. Whether you’re someone who’s never had a strategy or someone who’s been failing despite one — the Code rewires your approach to focus on execution mastery, not just analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what sets this apart is who’s behind it. We are Silent Equity — three traders who remained anonymous, not to hide, but to shift the spotlight from ourselves to the process. Our journey was not glamorous. We failed for years. We burned through capital, chased strategies, and lived the emotional spiral that so many traders go through. We built this system from experience — not theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re not here to sell you dreams. We’re here to give you the system we never got — one that took us from chaos to clarity, from illusion to real profitability. In a world full of noise and false promises, Silent Equity is about building traders in silence to create impact that speaks volumes.
